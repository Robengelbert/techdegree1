        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>I started learning to code on W3 schools and Khan academy, and after the first simple website I created I was hooked. I knew this was the career I should of trained for from the beginning.</p>
        <p>I don't remember how I found Treehouse, I also don't know where I would be without it. I have learned so much from watching the videos and doing the code challenges, and I love the resourse section of the videos linking to other sites and documentation.</p>

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>I want to create a career I can be proud of, one where I can earn enough money to put my kids through college, and be able to retire someday in the distant future.</p>
        <p>I’d like to make the world a better place one website at a time.</p>
